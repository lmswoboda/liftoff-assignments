# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview

My husband is a high school football coach.  I want to create a website for the coaches, parents,
players, alumni, and fans.  It will conveniently and efficiently addresses many of their SCW Warrior
Football questions, while promoting communication, in order to increase involvement and paricipation
in the SCW Football Family.  The website will have pages addressing rosters, schedules, stats,
accomplishments, parent information/forms, weight room, fundraisers, how to order gear, coach
blog/notification, pictures, video, and a SCW Football Family blog.

## Features
User login: SCW Football Family members will be able to create accounts, and log in to the
application.

Search: Users will be to search stats by year, player or game.

Stat input: Coaches will be able to enter rosters, schedules, and stats when logged in.

Blog Posts:  Coaches will be able to enter new blog posts when logged in.  New blog posts will appear
in the Coaches blog.

Forms:  Coaches will be able to upload parental forms to the website.  Users will be able to download
forms from the website
